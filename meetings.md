 -Summary of meeting
    - Initial meeting was not exactly meant to be a team meeting as our meeting was set for 2022-11-17 at 18:30 - 19:00. This was initially just for Tan to teach me (Joao) how to understand HTML, CSS, and bootstrap. From there we found that everyone was online so we eventually turned it into a meeting. With that, we started talking about what we have accomplished so far. Currently, we have gone over the 12 functional requirements and what we have to do within the next week. Alongside this, we also are coming up with 4 non-functional requirements as we progress throughout the week. We also have passed the design stage in which we know how we want our website to look and where the functions are going to be located. From here we moved on to what each of us is going to be doing with this project and dividing up the work in the future. Currently, we are just setting up everything regarding the front end and once we have all that set up we will implement the functionalities. Overall we have found ourselves with a good pace and are set to finish before Wednesday.
